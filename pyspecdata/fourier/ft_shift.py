    r"""Clears memory of where the origins in the time and frequency domain are.
    This is useful, *e.g.* when you want to ift and center about time=0.
    By setting shift=True you can also manually set the points.

    Parameters
    ==========
    t: float, 'current', 'reset', or None
        keyword arguments `t` and `f` can be set by (1) manually setting
        the start point (2) using the string 'current' to leave the
        current setting a lone (3) 'reset', which clears the startpoint
        and (4) None, which will be changed to 'current' when the other is set to a number or 'rest' if both are set to None.
    t: float, 'current', 'reset', or None
        see `t`
    nearest: bool
        Shifting the startpoint can only be done
        by an integral number of datapoints
        (*i.e.* an integral number of dwell
        times, dt, in the time domain or
        integral number of df in the frequency
        domain).
        While it is possible to shift by a
        non-integral number of datapoints,
        this is done by applying a
        phase-dependent shift in the inverse
        domain.
        Applying such a axis-dependent shift
        can have vary unexpected effects if the
        data in the inverse domain is aliased,
        and is therefore heavily discouraged.
        (For example, consider what happens if
        we attempt to apply a
        frequency-dependent phase shift to data
        where a peak at 110 Hz is aliased and
        appears at the 10 Hz position.)

        Setting `nearest` to **True**
        will choose a startpoint at the closest
        integral datapoint to what you have
        specified.

        Setting `nearest` to **False**
        will explicitly override the safeties --
        essentially telling the code that you
        know the data is not aliased in the
        inverse domain and/or are willing to
        deal with the consequences.
