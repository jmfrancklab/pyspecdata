def ift(self,axes,n=False,tolerance = 1e-5,verbose = False,**kwargs):
    r"""This performs an inverse Fourier transform along the axes identified by the string or list of strings `axes`.

    It adjusts normalization and units so that the result conforms to
            :math:`s(t)=t_{dw} \int_{x_{min}}^{x_{max}} \tilde{s}(f) e^{i 2 \pi f t} df`
    Where :math:`t_{dw}=\frac{1}{\Delta f}`, is the dwell time (with :math:`\Delta f` the spectral width).

    *Why do we do this?* Note that while the analytical integral this corresponds to is normalized, performing
    :meth:`~pyspecdata.nddata.ft` followed by :meth:`~pyspecdata.nddata.ift` on a discrete sequence is NOT completely invertible
    (due to integration of the implied comb function??),
    and would require division by a factor of :math:`\Delta f` (the spectral width) in order
    to retrieve the original function

    **pre-IFT**, we use the axis to cyclically permute :math:`f=0` to the first index

    **post-IFT**, we assume that the data has previously been FT'd
    If this is the case, passing ``shift=True`` will cause an error
    If this is not the case, passing ``shift=True`` generates a standard ifftshift
    ``shift=None`` will choose True, if and only if this is not the case

    Parameters
    ----------
    pad : int or boolean
        `pad` specifies a zero-filling.  If it's a number, then it gives
        the length of the zero-filled dimension.  If it is just `True`,
        then the size of the dimension is determined by rounding the
        dimension size up to the nearest integral power of 2.   It uses the
        `start_time` ft property to determine the start of the axis.  To
        do this, it assumes that it is a stationary signal
        (convolved with infinite comb function).
        The value of `start_time` can differ from by a non-integral multiple of
        :math:`\Delta t`, though the routine will check whether or not it is safe to
        do this.

        ..note ::
            In the code, this is controlled by `p2_post` (the integral
            :math:`\Delta t` and `p2_post_discrepancy` -- the non-integral.
