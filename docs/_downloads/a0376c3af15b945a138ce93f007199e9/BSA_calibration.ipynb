        "\n# BSA UV-Vis Calibration\n\nThis example is specifically designed to process data from a BSA calibration curve lab exercise.\n\nTo run the curve for your data:\n\n-   Make sure the data is stored on google drive in the\n    `exp_data/UV_Vis/BSA_calib` directory, and your computer is set up so that\n    your `_pyspecdata` file points to google drive.\n-   Just make a copy of this file, change the name of the BSW file to point to your data\n-   Then edit the table inside the OrderedDict below so that it gives the\n    correct labels and scan names for all the spectra in your run.\n-   edit the `background` parameter below so that it points to the scan that\n    you want to function as your baseline/background.\n    -   We would rather record the raw absorbance values, rather than rely on\n        the spectrometer to subtract and hide the absorbance values of our\n        baseline.\n"
