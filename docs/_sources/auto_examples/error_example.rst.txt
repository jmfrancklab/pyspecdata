Error and units example
=======================

Here is a simple example of errors and unit propagation

Notice that the base nddata class supplies error and propagation similar
to uncertainty-type libraries.

For the units, `pint` is doing the heavy lifting here.

As a simple example, say that we perform several measurements of a
volume (not sure physically why we would have such variability, but
let's roll with it to keep the example simple!)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 21-24

.. code-block:: Python


    vol = psd.nddata(r_[1.10, 1.11, 1.02, 1.03, 1.00, 1.05]).set_units("L")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-26

Similarly, let's take some measurements of the weight of a solute!

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-29

.. code-block:: Python


    weight = psd.nddata(r_[2.10, 2.61, 2.002, 2.73, 2.33, 2.69]).set_units("μg")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 30-38

To test our error propagation below, we're going to divide the two
arrays here -- because the variability of this number should be somewhat
similar to the propagated error below (though of course, there is a
statistical difference, and doing the two things does mean something
different).
Notice how, during string conversion, we always give the standard error
2 significant figures, and then base the significant figures of the
number on the error.

We take the mean, allowing it to accumulate the standard error.
(See comment above about significant figures.)
