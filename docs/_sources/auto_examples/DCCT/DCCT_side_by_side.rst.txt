Arranging Multiple DCCT Plots
=============================

Visualize a simulated inversion recovery dataset
utilizing the benefits of the DCCT plotting style.

We can image data in both the phase cycling domain,
as well as the coherence transfer domain. Artifacts can
clearly be discerned from signal in the coherence transfer
domain as well as visualizing the inversion of phase 
using the domain colored plotting style.
