"""Upload the UV example files to Zenodo
-------------------------------------

This example demonstrates how to locate each data file used in the
:mod:`examples.UV` package and upload them all to the same Zenodo deposition.
The deposition reserves a DOI, sets the resource type to ``dataset``, and
marks today's date as available.

To run this script you must create a personal access token on the Zenodo
website (with ``deposit:write`` scope).  Save the token in a file and reference
it from the ``[zenodo]`` section of ``~/.pyspecdata``::

    [zenodo]
    token_file = /path/to/zenodo.token

A new deposition record will be created automatically for the first file and the
remaining files will be uploaded to that same deposition.
